# eBC EBooks Collection ToolBox

The eBooks Collection Toolbox (eBC) contains simple tools for
managing a collection of electronic documents written in Clojure.

It has the following features:

- The collection of documents is hierarchically organized in the
	filesystem by a simple naming convention.
- eBC generates a directory of HTML pages for browsing the
	collection.
- eBC generates (and updates) a full-text index of the ebooks
	collection (using the Apache Lucene library).
- eBC allows to search the full-text index.

The [manual](http://homepages.thm.de/~hg11260/mat/ebc.pdf) is available
from the projects [homepage](https://esb-dev.github.io/ebc.html).
